The scripts saves the valid URL's to a .json file.

### Instructions
It's easy:
- The script will ask to choose between domain 1 or 2 (only for 2 in 1)
- Then it wil ask for how many valid URL's will generate
- Then it will ask if you want to open it in the webbrowser
- Then it runs.

If you want to open all URL's from the JSON file use the [jsonopener file](https://github.com/Trying2bAHacker/Link-Generators/blob/main/jsonopener.py)
- Input the path to the successful_urls.json file. (The path needs to look like this: Drive\...\successful_urls.json
